Nuovo/Nouveau spreadsheet-reader is, well, a spreadsheet reader with the difference that my only goal for it was efficient data extraction that could handle large (as in really large) files. So far I cannot definitely say that it is CPU, time or IO-efficient but at least it won't run out of memory (except for XLS files).

So far XLSX and text/CSV file parsing should be memory-efficient. XLS file parsing is done with php-excel-reader from http://code.google.com/p/php-excel-reader/ which, sadly, has memory issues with bigger spreadsheets.

Usage is very simple:

<?php
	// If you need to parse XLS files, include php-excel-reader
	require('php-excel-reader/excel_reader.php');

	require('SpreadsheetReader.php');

	$Reader = new SpreadsheetReader('example.xlsx');
	foreach ($Reader as $Row)
	{
		print_r($Row);
	}
?>

TODOs:
- Add support for ODS spreadsheets;
- XLSX XML parsing suffers from an occasional Shliemel the painter moment (sharedStrings.xml)
